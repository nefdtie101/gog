                <p>
                    We started out as a group of friends in high-school just casually playing games together.
                    Over the years our small group expanded. Soon we had people from different schools joining our server.
                    As time went by we starting expanding all over South-Africa. Eventually we even reached certain individuals
                    over-seas. With our group growing older, we had more assets at our disposal.

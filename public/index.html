      content="We started out as a group of friends in high-school just casually playing games together. Over the years our small group expanded. Soon we had people from different schools joining our server. As time went by we starting expanding all over South-Africa. Eventually we even reached certain individuals over-seas. With our group growing older, we had more assets at our disposal. One of our members, Johann Nefdt, offered to host us servers in games such as ARK and Rust. With an expanding group and a server in development, we decided to get the domain as well, so that we can reach out to more people to join our server."
